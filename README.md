# MPMB-Thaevur/Iron Sphere
Adds the Thaevur/Iron Sphere from a video on Ed Greenwood's YouTube channel to the MPMB Character Sheets. I can't find any reference to this item as it is described in the video on the internet, so I feel like this item is likely an April Fools joke by Ed Greenwood. However, I thought it was interesting enough to code into reality, taking inspiration for the mechanics of this Thaevur/Iron Sphere from a comment on the video by the user "Pelinore Geryon" (@pelinoregeryon6593) that mentions 1st edition variants of Ioun Stones. Since no mention is made of how the Thaevur/Iron Spheres recover from an overloaded state and/or become able to absorb more magic again aside from a line that they "use the absorbed magic to stay afloat" (paraphrased quote), I made the decision to say that they use 1d12 SL of stored magic per day to do just that.

**Known Bugs:**
- No known bugs at this time. Will update when any are found.

# Thaevur/Iron Sphere
*Wondrous item, rare/very rare/legendary*

**Attunement:** No

**Description:** A grapefruit sized or smaller sphere of a non-ferrous material & of a dark brown, rust hued, or black color that can absorb the magic of spells. These spheres are commonly referred to as "Iron Spheres", though a more accurate, but far lesser known, name for these spheres would be "Thaevur Spheres".

Into the surface of the sphere is carved a word in Common; speaking the word aloud while holding the sphere causes the speaker to become the sphere's "bearer", at which point the sphere will begin orbiting their torso.

When not confined such that the sphere cannot orbit its bearer, any spell that targets the sphere, its bearer, or that includes the sphere or its bearer in its AOE is absorbed by the sphere.

The bearer can use a Bonus Action to will the sphere to "turn off or on" to either allow or disallow spells to be cast on the bearer. The bearer can also use their Bonus Action to revoke their status as the sphere's bearer, which causes the sphere to stop floating in the same manner as when overloaded or exhasuted of magical energy, as described below.

When the sphere is exhausted of its stored magic or is overloaded beyond its magical storage capacity, it will sink down to the nearest surface directly below itself.

Depending on the rarity of the sphere, the sphere can absorb the following, exact amounts rolled upon generation of the sphere by the DM or upon a sphere's creation:
- 3d10+10 SL of 4th Lvl or lower (Rare)
- 4d10+20 SL of 6th Lvl or lower (Very Rare)
- 5d10+30 SL of 8th Lvl or lower (Legendary)

The last charge is enough to absorb any spell of a spell level that the sphere is capable of absorbing. The sphere will use 1d12 SL of stored magic per day to stay afloat.

If multiple spheres are in a position to absorb a spell, only one sphere chosen at random will absorb that spell.
